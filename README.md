# ComplexitySpace-in-R
R functions used to analyze control systems using the Law of Requisite Complexity. 
Since this is a first version, it is not in the form of an R package. 
Rather, it contains R scripts such as the one required for complexity calculation, 
complexity measures and the Complexity Space visualization. 

These extends our previous Matlab discrete Entropy-based complexity measures https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2017.00010.
Have fun. Dont forget to cite our work.
